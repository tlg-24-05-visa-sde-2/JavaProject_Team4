# Getting Started with the new and Improved Create-React-App

- This is the new improved version from my own cli
- Here you will have most of the libraries you need pre-installed and ready to get hacking.
- The Navbar and footer are already build using react-bootstrap and MDBBootstrap
- run the `npm start` command and go checkout your new create react app template

## Pages

### Home Page
- This page is a boiler plate that leverages the Navbar and Footer component, customize them as needed

### Login Page
- This page contains a React Bootstrap form that takes in a username or email and a users password
- You can update this as need but you should have most of the tools you need to easily set this up package and send your data to an endpoint 

### Signup Page
- The signup page contains a React Bootstrap form ready to take in a bunch of user parameters. It is already prepped and stored in a state variable that is updated through a handler function. The submit function is ready for you to package up your data and send it to an endpoint

## Components

### Navbar
- The navbar is built using React Bootstrap, edit and change it as needed. 
- The links are all dummy links so you will need to update those all except for the home link

### Footer
- The footer is built using MDB, feel free to update or scrap it. Use at your projects needs

## Classes
- Included in the utils folder is the AuthService class. This class is set up and primed for you to send of your login and signup data to your desired endpoint. Other authentication logic can be added here.
